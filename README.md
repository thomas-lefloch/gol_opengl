# Conway's game of life
conway's game of life to learn opengl

dirty version. I'll clean this up later or not ... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

CONTROLS

* space to start/pause 

TODO
* separate game state and rendering? from main.cpp 
* support window resize
* indicates when game is paused/running
 * refactor neighbors counting

* randomly generated life (mathusalem)
* add test
