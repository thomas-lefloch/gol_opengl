# Conway's game of life
conway's game of life to learn opengl

this is my first c++ project so it's dirty.  
I'll probably clean this up later ... or not ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

### Controls
* Left click to kill/put life into cells
* Space to start/pause 

### Todo
* Separate game state and rendering? from main.cpp 
* Support window resize
* Indicate when game is paused/running
 * Refactor neighbors counting
* Support for holding left mouse button
* Randomly generated life (mathusalem, ...)
* Test
